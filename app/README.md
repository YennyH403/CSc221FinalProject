# Calendar App with Add-on Features (Calorie Counter, Recipe Suggestions, and Workout Suggestions)

This is a final project for a CSc 221 Software Design course. 

We are building an addon feature for the calendar app that tries to implement:
- Calorie Counter
- Recipe Suggestions ("Recipe of the Day")
- Workout Suggestions ("Workout of the Day")
- Intermittent Fasting (Did not get to this feature)

The calendar app was based off of a YouTube calendar implementation tutorial. 
 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba0Q-cK1fJo&t=0s&ab_channel=CodeWithCal

We decided to add some features onto the calendar app because we thought that it could be more 
functional. Since some of us puts our todos onto the calendar as reminders, for those that want to 
keep track of their lifestyle and putting their reminders together, it would be a great way to stay 
motivated. 

Additional Feature (App View): Light and Dark Mode
